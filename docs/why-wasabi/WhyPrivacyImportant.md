# Why Privacy is Important

> It's not that I have something to hide. It's that I have nothing to share.

Privacy is the selective revealing of Your Self to Your peers.
You have many thoughts in Your mind which You choose to never tell anyone, and many of Your actions are never witnessed by another person.
The ability to keep a secret is an essential part of the human experience.

- Why do You draw the curtains at night?
- Why do You close the door when in the shower?
- Why do You send Your love letters only to Your spouse?

Economic trade of goods and services is based on mutual beneficial voluntary action. But when an outside authority demands that the peers reveal the details of their exchange, then they must beg for permission of every act.
Yet individuals can use the tools of self defense at their disposal to regain their sovereignty.

> Without financial privacy, there is no human dignity.
