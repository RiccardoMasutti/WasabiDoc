that for every payment you can use a new address that is not tied to any of your previous addresses.
When you use a new address for every coin, then it becomes much much more difficult to find out that these coins are from you.
However, when you use the same address for every coin, then everyone knows that they all can be spend by one individual who has knowledge of the private key - you!
Thus, when someone finds out that you have that address, maybe you published it in your social media profile for donations, or you send a coin to another peer who knows you, then they know also how many bitcoin you have in the other coins with that same address.
Take good care to whom you tell your addresses, and every time, tell someone a different address.</p> <p>Because you have all the private keys, for all these addresses, you can produce a valid signature for any of them.
So you can proof that these are your bitcoin, without relying on reputation that you have any other coins.
You can easily generate and store many billions of private keys and addresses in a convenient <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BIP 44 multi-account hierarchy for deterministic wallets<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> so that you can backup everything in your 12 word mnemonic phrase.</p> <p>This is what is used in Wasabi, you have on mnemonic backup, and unlimited numbers of new addresses.
Everytime you a coin is received, then the address is removed from the GUI so that you are not tempted to use it again.</p> <p>Remember: <em><strong>NEVER RE-USE ADDRESSES</strong></em></p> <h3 id="why-does-wasabi-only-use-segwit-bech32-addresses"><a href="#why-does-wasabi-only-use-segwit-bech32-addresses" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Why does Wasabi only use SegWit bech32 addresses?</h3> <p>Wasabi generates Bech32 addresses only, also known as bc1 addresses or native SegWit addresses.
These addresses start with the characters <code>bc1...</code> Some wallets/exchanges do not yet support this type of address and may give an error message (e.g. &quot;unknown bitcoin address&quot;).
The solution is to manage your funds with a wallet which does support Bech32, <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32_adoption" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see list<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>.</p> <p>Be careful, if you send all your coins from an old wallet to a new wallet (from the table above) in one transaction then you will merge all your coins which is bad for privacy - instead, <strong>send the coins individually</strong> or if possible <strong>import the seed in the new wallet</strong>.</p> <h2 id="send"><a href="#send" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Send</h2> <h3 id="why-does-wasabi-choose-a-new-random-node-every-time-i-send-a-transaction"><a href="#why-does-wasabi-choose-a-new-random-node-every-time-i-send-a-transaction" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Why does Wasabi choose a new random node every time I send a transaction?</h3> <p>When you broadcast a transaction from a full node, that transaction is flooded into the network.
Essentially, all nearby nodes are passed your transaction, and those nodes will pass to all of their nearby nodes, etc.
However, if a malicious adversary were to get enough relay nodes in the network, they could pretty easily connect the initial location of a transaction by simply observing from which node the transaction appeared first.
For this reason, broadcasting transaction through your own node may reveal your IP address.</p> <p>So to fix this Wasabi broadcasts your transactions to a random node, and messages that node through TOR, so the node cannot detect your IP address.
When you want to subsequently send another transaction on the network, Wasabi destroys the original TOR bridge and connection to the node and established a new TOR bridge and connection with a brand new node.
This reduces the risk of a passive bystander being able to link two transactions together that appear from the same location.</p> <h2 id="history"><a href="#history" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> History</h2> <h2 id="coinjoin"><a href="#coinjoin" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> CoinJoin</h2> <h3 id="what-are-the-fees-for-the-coinjoin"><a href="#what-are-the-fees-for-the-coinjoin" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are the fees for the CoinJoin?</h3> <p>You currently pay a fee of 0.003% * anonymity set.
If the anonymity set of a coin is 50 then you pay 0.003% * 50 (=0.15%).
If you set the target anonymity set to 53 then Wasabi will continue mixing until this is reached, so you may end up with an anonymity set of say 60, and you will pay 0.003% * 60 (=0.18%).</p> <p>There are also edge cases where you do not pay the full fee or where you pay more.
For example if you're the smallest registrant to a round, you will never pay a fee.
Also when you are remixing and you cannot pay the full fee with your input, then you only pay as much as you have, but if the change amount leftover would be too small, then that is also added to the fee.
Currently the minimum change amount to be paid out is 0.7% of the base denomination (~0.1BTC.)</p> <p>It is also possible that you get more back from mixing than you put in.
This happens when network fees go down between the start of the round and its end.

Bob sends to the Wasabi coordinator: [i] the clear-text address for the anonset CoinJoin output; [ii] the coordinator signature over that output; and [iii] the round Hash of all the inputs.
Because the coordinator can verify his own signature, he knows that this output was initially sent by any Alice [he cannot know which Alice exactly] and that he has verified that everything was in order.</p> <p>It is very important that the coordinator cannot link Alice to Bob.
Because Alice has send the clear-text input, and Bob sends the clear-text output.
So, if the two were to be linked, then the coordinator can specifically link the input to the output, meaning that the anonymity set is 1.
Because Alice commits to the output by sending it blinded, and because Bob is a new tor identity not linked to Alice, the coordinator can verify that nobody is cheating, but he cannot deanonymize the peers.</p> <p>The output registration phase ends when the value of clear-text outputs plus change outputs is equal to the the value of inputs.

This links all the consolidated UTXOs in one transaction, creating only one output, which then clearly controls all these funds.
That said, if you combine less than 1 BTC it is less likely to reveal your pre-CoinJoin transaction history.
The potential issue comes when you spend that coin. Depending on what you do with the coin you might reduce the privacy of the resulting change (if you send half your coin to an exchange for example, as they will know that you own the coin change).
As a result it is best not to recombine ALL your mixed change, though you may wish to recombine some coins if you are planning on hodling for many years as this will reduce the fees required to spend the coins later.</p> <p>If you would like to dive into the details of this topic, you can <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/WasabiWallet/comments/avxbjy/combining_mixed_coins_privacy_megathread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read more here<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> and see more here:</p> <div class="ytEmbed"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Tk8-N1kHa4g" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay;encrypted-media;picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div> <h3 id="how-can-i-send-my-anonset-coins-to-my-hardware-wallet"><a href="#how-can-i-send-my-anonset-coins-to-my-hardware-wallet" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> How can I send my anonset coins to my hardware wallet?</h3> <p>Most hardware wallets communicate with servers to provide you with your balance.
This reveals your public key to the server, which damages your privacy - the hardware company can now theoretically link together all your addresses.
As a result <strong>it is not recommended</strong> that you send your mixed coins to an address associated with your hardware wallet unless you are confident that you have set up your hardware wallet in a way that it does not communicate with a 3rd party server (see below).</p> <p>You can, however, manage your hardware wallet with the Wasabi interface.
Alternatively, you can use your hardware wallet with Electrum, which connects to your Bitcoin Core full node through <a href="https://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electrum Personal Server<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>.</p> <h3 id="what-can-i-do-with-small-change"><a href="#what-can-i-do-with-small-change" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> What can I do with small change?</h3> <p>There are no hard and fast rules for what to do with the change.
Generally try to avoid the change and use the <code>Max</code> button extensively to send whole coins.
The most problematic type of change is what has <code>anonymity set 1</code> [red shield] You should treat it as a kind of toxic waste [handled with great care].</p> <p><strong>Warning</strong></p> <p>You want to avoid merging <code>anonymity set 1 coins</code> with <code>anonymity set &gt; 1 coins</code> wherever possible, because this will link your <code>anonymity set &gt; 1 coin</code> to the coin you merge it with.
Note that, this is also true if you merge them in a mix, however that is slightly less problematic, because some blockchain analysis techniques become <a href="https://www.comsys.rwth-aachen.de/fileadmin/papers/2017/2017-maurer-trustcom-coinjoin.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">computationally infeasible<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>.</p> <p>It is also important that you do not send different coins to the same receiving address (even if performed as separate transactions) as this will also link the coins together, damaging your privacy.</p> <p>There are two different types of zero link change:</p> <p>When you have a KYC coin with red anonset 1 and you register it for CoinJoin, then you get one anonset 100 green coin and one red anonset 1 change.
This change is very clearly tied to your KYC input coin, but the CoinJoin output is pretty good with anonset 100.
If you combine that red coin with the green, then it's clear that both of them belong to you, and thus the anonset of the output in this transactioin becomes the lowest common denominator, in this case anonset 1.</p> <p>When you take a 100 anonset coin, and you register it again for CoinJoin, then you get one coin with anonset 200, and one change with anonset 100.
This change has anonset 100 because it can be linked to the input of the second CoinJoin, but this coin has anonset 100 already.
So, although this change can still reveal pre-mix history, because the pr-mix history is another CoinJoin, you cannot go farther back.
So, it might be ok to send this second change output to some place, or even consolidate it, because it still has anonset.</p> <p>When you consolidate several small change coins in a regular transaction, then every outside observer knows that they belong to the same cluster.
However, you can consolidate within a CoinJoin by simply selecting all these coins in the CoinJoin tab.
Because the Wasabi CoinJoin transaction shuffles inputs, for an outside observer it is not clear which inputs belong to the same Alice.
However, the coordinator gets the input proof of <strong>ALL</strong> the coins that Alice has provided during the input registration phase.
Thus the coordinator knows that this is a consolidation transaction.
It is wise to assume that every one knows what the coordinator knows.
So consolidating in a CoinJoin is better, but it might still reveal the common ownership of the coins.</p> <p><strong>Your Options</strong></p> <ul><li>If you do not care about linking the history of
